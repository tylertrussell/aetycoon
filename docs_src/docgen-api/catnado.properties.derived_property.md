## Functions
    
### `DerivedProperty`

Implements a 'derived' datastore property.

  Derived properties are not set directly, but are instead generated by a
  function when required. They are useful to provide fields in the datastore
  that can be used for filtering or sorting in ways that are not otherwise
  possible with unmodified data - for example, filtering by the length of a
  BlobProperty, or case insensitive matching by querying the lower cased version
  of a string.

  DerivedProperty can be declared as a regular property, passing a function as
  the first argument, or it can be used as a decorator for the function that
  does the calculation, either with or without arguments.
